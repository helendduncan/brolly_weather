# Brolly Weather Repo
Because it looks like it is going to rain today.

The first thing I did after making this repo was to clone it to my local machine. I did this via:
```
git clone git@github.com:helendduncan/brolly_weather.git
```

You may notice that the repo also has a license, I just picked a default one from the options on initialisation.

Most repos have a `README.md` file which is where I put the most important or headline information.
